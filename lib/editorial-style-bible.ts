export const READER_NORMALIZATION_RULES = `READER NORMALIZATION (book-first):
- Convert live-audience delivery to reader-facing prose.
- Never address a live audience anywhere in the book.
- Remove room-control cues and response prompts (e.g., "say amen", "look at your neighbor", applause cues, altar-response directives).
- Rewrite stage/location references ("in this room", "as you sit here today") into direct reader language.
- Preserve meaning, doctrine, and argument sequence exactly; only change delivery mode.`;

export const SOURCE_LOCK_RULES = `SOURCE-LOCK FIDELITY — ZERO FABRICATION POLICY:
- Every sentence must trace directly to the provided transcript. If you cannot point to the exact words, idea, story, or argument in the source material, that sentence must not exist in the output.
- This ban is absolute. It includes: plausible extensions of what the author might mean; common theological context the author "probably" knows; general truths that "fit" the teaching; biographical details you can reasonably infer; and any content that feels consistent with the author's voice but is not explicitly present in the transcript.
- DELETION IS ALWAYS CORRECT. When source material is thin, write fewer sentences — not padded ones. Three transcript-faithful sentences are better than five where two are invented.
- You may improve clarity, re-order for logic, and smooth transitions — but only using the author's own words and ideas.
- FABRICATION TEST: Before finalizing every sentence, ask: "Is this exact idea, story, or claim present in the provided transcript?" If the answer is no, delete the sentence.`;

export const PREMIUM_BOOK_STYLE_RULES = `PREMIUM BOOK STYLE STANDARDS:

STYLISTIC LIBERTY — WHAT YOU OWN:
You have full creative authority over sentence structure, word choice, rhythm, rhetorical devices, and paragraph architecture. Use this freedom deliberately:
- Choose the most precise and vivid word available — not the first synonym that fits.
- Invert sentence structure for emphasis when it serves the idea.
- Use rhetorical questions, fragments for emphasis, and colons to land a point.
- Reorder sentences within a paragraph to build better logical momentum.
- The CONTENT (every idea, argument, story, claim, and fact) is locked to the transcript. The PRESENTATION is yours. These are separate decisions. Never confuse them.
- If a passage can be said in three ways and all three are accurate to the source, choose the one with the most force.

EM DASH BAN (absolute — zero exceptions):
- Never use an em dash (—) for any purpose in the prose.
- Never use spaced em dashes ( — ), unspaced em dashes (—), or double hyphens (--) used as em dashes.
- Rewrite every sentence that would require an em dash: use a comma, colon, semicolon, or subordinate clause ("which," "who," "although," "because," "while," "since") instead. Only split into two sentences when both halves are genuinely strong standalone thoughts — not just because the em dash is gone.

PARAGRAPH CRAFT:
- No paragraph should exceed 5 sentences. Short paragraphs (1–2 sentences) are not weakness; they are emphasis.
- Vary opening words across consecutive paragraphs. Never start two adjacent paragraphs with the same word or phrase.
- End each paragraph with either a strong declarative statement or a forward-pulling question — never a flat summary restatement.
- Occasionally let a paragraph close on an incomplete thought. A fragment. It signals voice, not error.

SENTENCE RHYTHM & FLOW (global literary standards):
- Mix sentence lengths deliberately: long sentences build momentum and explain; short sentences land the blow. Never write five short sentences in a row — that reads like a bullet list, not prose.
- When a thought would have used an em dash, prefer a subordinate clause over a period. "She left. She was afraid." → "She left, afraid of what she might find." Use "although," "because," "while," "since," "which," and "who" to bind related ideas before reaching for a full stop.
- No three consecutive sentences should share the same approximate length or grammatical structure.
- Vary sentence openings: leading participial phrases ("Having set this foundation..."), inverted constructions ("What the disciples expected was power; what they received was a flame."), and sentences that open with a prepositional phrase or subordinate clause.
- Semicolons are encouraged: use them to join two closely related independent clauses that belong in the same breath of thought.
- Colons introduce conclusions and explanations — prefer them where an em dash would have appeared.
- Avoid passive constructions. Rewrite every "it was found that" and "there is a sense in which" into direct active claims.
- Use contractions where they occur naturally in prose (it's, you're, that's, don't, isn't, won't). They read human; stiff formal constructions read robotic.

PASSIVE VOICE — ZERO TOLERANCE (scan every sentence before returning):
Passive constructions drain authority from prose. Identify and rewrite every instance before finalizing output.

BANNED PASSIVE PATTERNS (rewrite all of these):
- "is/are/was/were + past participle": "is seen," "was found," "are called," "were given" → find the actor and make them the subject.
- "there is/there are/there was/there were": "There is a tendency to" → "Writers tend to"; "There was a moment when" → name the moment directly.
- "it is/it was + adjective/past participle": "It is important to note," "It was decided that," "It is believed that" → delete or recast.
- "God is known as," "Jesus is referred to as," "Paul is considered" → "God is," "Jesus serves as," "Paul functions as."
- "we are called to," "we are meant to," "believers are told to" → "the call is," "the imperative is," "the text commands."
- "can be seen," "can be found," "should be noted" → show it; do not narrate that it can be seen.

ACTIVE REWRITE METHOD: Ask "Who is doing what?" and make the doer the subject. If there is no clear doer from the transcript, delete the sentence rather than inventing one.

TENSE CONSISTENCY (enforce in every paragraph before returning):
- Use PRESENT TENSE for teaching, principles, theological claims, and application: "Faith works through love," not "Faith worked through love." "Paul argues," not "Paul argued."
- Use PAST TENSE only for historical narrative events and specific stories: "Moses parted the sea," "When Peter walked on water."
- Never mix tenses within the same paragraph when discussing the same subject. If you begin expounding a scripture in present tense, every sentence of that exposition stays present tense.
- Scripture exposition is always present tense: the text "says," "teaches," "commands," "warns" — never "said," "taught," "commanded."
- Consistency check: scan every paragraph for tense shifts before finalizing. A drift from present to past in the same paragraph is an error.

FORBIDDEN PHRASES (hard ban — delete or rewrite every instance):
"In conclusion" | "It's important to note" | "It is crucial to remember" | "Let's delve into" | "A tapestry of" | "Navigating the landscape" | "In today's fast-paced world" | "Furthermore" | "Moreover" | "It is worth noting" | "At the end of the day" | "Game-changer" | "Paradigm shift" | "Deep dive" | "Unpack" | "Moving forward" | "Robust" | "Leverage" | "Synergy" | "It goes without saying" | "The truth is," | "The fact of the matter is" | "Indeed," | "Certainly," | "Ultimately," | "At its core," | "In essence," | "Simply put," | "Not just...but" | "Not merely...but" | "This is not merely" | "profoundly" | "deeply meaningful" | "transformative" | "journey" (used metaphorically) | "vibrant" | "fostering" | "crucial" | "vital" (overused)

PAIRED INTENSIFIER BAN:
- Never join two adjectives with "and" when either alone would be stronger: "clear and compelling" → "compelling"; "rich and complex" → "complex"; "deep and meaningful" → choose one word.

OPENING SENTENCES:
- Never open a paragraph with a direct re-statement of the section heading just used.
- Never open with a generalization when a specific detail from the transcript is available.
- Avoid opening with "This chapter", "This section", or "In this passage" — drop the reader into the idea, not a table of contents.

TRANSITIONS:
- Transitions must create logical pull toward the next idea, not summarize what just happened.
- Mid-chapter summary transitions ("So, as we have seen...", "To summarize...") are forbidden.
- Never stack two rhetorical questions in back-to-back sentences.

HUMANIZATION RULES (anti-AI detection — enforce rigorously):
- Break perfect parallel structure. If a list of three things has matching grammatical form, make one of them slightly different in structure.
- Avoid "X is not just A; it is B" and "X is not merely A, it is B" sentence frames — these are AI signatures.
- Avoid the double-comma appositive: "Love, the foundation of all things, is..." — rewrite as a separate sentence.
- Never follow a big claim with "This means that..." or "What this tells us is..." — land the implication directly.
- Avoid ending three or more consecutive paragraphs with a question.
- Do not summarize what a scripture quote says immediately after quoting it. Trust the reader.

KEY TERM CONSISTENCY:
- Identify the author's preferred term for key concepts from the Voice DNA preferredTerminology. Use that exact term throughout — never swap in a synonym for variety.
- If the author says "agape love," every reference in the chapter uses "agape love," not "God's love," "divine love," or "unconditional love."
- Inconsistent terminology is a mark of unpolished writing. Standardize on the author's own words.

DIALOGUE AND CONVERSATION FORMATTING:
When the author recounts a conversation, exchange, or paraphrased dialogue (including conversations with God, prayers, or interpersonal exchanges from the transcript), apply these formatting rules:

- PARAPHRASED CONVERSATIONS: Keep them in flowing prose. Do not use theatrical dialogue tags or quotation marks for paraphrased speech. Instead, use indirect reported speech: "He told her it would be okay" not "He said, 'It will be okay.'"
- DIRECT QUOTES FROM SCRIPTURE OR A REAL SOURCE: Use standard quotation marks. Only use direct quotes when the transcript provides the verbatim wording.
- AVOID PLAY-SCRIPT FORMAT: Never format a conversation as "Person A: [text]" and "Person B: [text]" — this is a devotional book, not a transcript.
- AVOID REPEATED "SAID/TOLD" TAGS: Never stack multiple "I said… He said… I told him… She told me" structures in adjacent sentences. Vary with action beats, indirect speech, and narrative transitions.
- PRAYER CONVERSATIONS: When the author recounts praying or hearing from God, keep the voice intimate but avoid putting words in God's mouth unless the transcript contains the author's explicit phrasing.
